# Defrosting Bacon
## Getting bacon quicker

There are multiple methods that seem to work for this task, but both carry the risk of partially cooking one's bacon. These methods are in no way guaranteed or scientifically tested; proceed with caution, or just leave you bacon in the fridge the night before.

### The microwave method

1. Is the bacon in packaging
	- (yes) Remove the packaging
	- (no) Continue
2. Place the bacon on a microwavable plate
3. Place the plate (with the bacon on) into the microwave
4. Microwave bacon repeat (4) until defrosted
	- Low power!
	- Short bursts (30 seconds)
	- Check bacon after each cycle
5. Do something with your bacon

### Hot water

1. Is the bacon in packaging
	- (yes) Remove packaging
	- (no) Continue
2. Heat some water
	- Not to boiling!
3. Put hot water it in a bowl
	- Be very careful!
	- Metal bowls aren't advisable
	- Bowl must be big enough to fit bacon
4. Put your bacon in the bowl
	- If the water does not submerge the bacon
		- Ignore if the bacon is floating
		- Top up if the bacon is not floating
			- And it is safe to do so!
				- Not going to cause overflow
5. Leave for 5 minutes repeat (5) until bacon is defrosted
	- Check bacon after each cycle
6. Do something with your bacon


### Cold Water

> A little slower than the heat based methods, but faster than the fridge. And no risk of accidentally cooking the bacon.

1. Is the bacon in packaging
    - (yes) Proceed
	- (no) Choose a different method
1. Empty all of the dirty dishes out of the sink.
1. Place the package of bacon under the faucet.
1. Run the cold water slowly over the bacon.
1. After 20 minutes, check every 10 minutes to see if it is thawed enough to cook. Times will vary based on
    - coldness of freezer
	- type of packaging
	- amount of bacon

### Defrosting in a Fridge
> The advantage of this method lays in the fact that you run no risk of cooking your bacon or forgetting it out unrefridgerated.
> The disadvantage is that it is slow

1. Have foresight
	- You need to start the process one day before you are going to use your bacon
2. Take your bacon out of the freezer
3. Put your bacon into the fridge
4. The next day take the bacon out of the fridge and use it
