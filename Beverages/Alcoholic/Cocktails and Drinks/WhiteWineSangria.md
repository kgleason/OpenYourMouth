# White Wine Sangria
This one is always a hit on a sunny day. I don't have a receipe to make it in a more
reasonable size.

### Ingredients

|Ingredients | US    |Metric |
|:-----------|:------|:------|
| Sweet white wine (Riesling or Gew√ºrztraminer) | 1 bottle  |  |
| Fruity white wine (Chardonnay) | 1 bottle | |
| 100% Apple juice | 34 fl oz | 1 l |
| Lemon lime soda | 34 fl oz | 1 l |
| Ginger ale | 34 fl oz | 1 l |
| Honey | 1/2 bear | 180 ml |
| Whole citrus fruits (lemons, limes, oranges. Mix as you wish) | 6 | |

### Instructions

1. Add about 1/2 of the apple juice to a sauce pan over medium heat.
1. Add all of the honey to the apple juice. Heat and stir until the honey is dissolved.
1. In a large container (like a 3 gallon beverage cooler!), combine the wine, the rest of the apple juice, and the sweetened apple juice. Stir to combine.
1. Add in all of the soda, and mix gently.
1. Cut the fruit into pieces or slices, and add in.
1. Add ice to fill the container.
1. Ideally let it all sit for an hour for the flavors to mix.
1. Be refreshed.

### A twist

If you are feeling particularly saucy, replace the apple juice with a 6 pack of hard cider. If the cider is sweet enough, you can skip the honey. It's next level stuff.
